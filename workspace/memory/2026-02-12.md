## Self-Improvement
- Read OpenAI blog post on Skills + Shell + Compaction patterns for long-running agents
- Applied key lessons to my own workspace:
  - Created MEMORY.md with curated long-term knowledge
  - Rewrote TOOLS.md with actual command references, templates, and routing logic
  - Documented common procedures so I don't rediscover things each session
  - Added email summary template for consistent categorization
- Key takeaways: templates in the right place, routing logic tables, document failures, continuity via MEMORY.md

## Hubstaff Automation Progress
- Xvfb installed and running on :99
- Python deps installed in venv at /opt/mouse-sim-env (pyautogui, pynput, python-xlib)
- Hubstaff binaries extracted from installer (bypassed broken MojoSetup GUI on Ubuntu 24.04 — GTK symbol mismatch `gtk_widget_device_is_shadowed`)
  - Extraction method: ZIP embedded at byte offset 524926 in the .sh installer
  - Installed to ~/.local/share/hubstaff/ with CLI symlinked to /usr/local/bin/HubstaffCLI
- HubstaffClient launched but stuck on "scripted control prompting user" dialog
- **BLOCKER:** Stephen needs to log in to HubstaffClient via VNC/TeamViewer — I can't see or interact with the FLTK GUI on headless Xvfb (screenshots come out black)
- Mouse sim script saved at /root/.openclaw/workspace/mouse_sim.py

## Email Access
- gog CLI fully working for Gmail (search, get, modify labels)
- Successfully summarized and marked emails as read multiple times
- Stake unsubscribe failed — React SPA needs real browser, gave Stephen direct link instead

## Flight Price Watcher
- Cron job running every 6h for AKL→MEL Apr 9-12 2026
- Job ID: ccce6dea-8cf8-44bd-94c6-71853c51889b
- Threshold: NZ$630. Prices seen: $588-634 (Qantas cheapest)
- Multiple alerts sent when prices dropped to ~$588-589

## Workspace Cleanup
- Deleted BOOTSTRAP.md (bootstrap complete)
- Created MEMORY.md, updated TOOLS.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md

## Pending Items
- Hubstaff login (needs Stephen's action)
- No Brave Search API key (web_search unavailable)
- No browser access from sandbox
- Stephen asked about job applications — offered to help find/track/tailor but not mass-apply
